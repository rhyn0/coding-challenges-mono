# Coding Challenges by Ryan

Monorepo of my attempts at doing [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/). Most attempts will be written in Rust as my language of choice.

## Code Quality

Using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) I enforce some code quality on code change.

Checks:
    - Formatting - using rustfmt
    - Linting - using clippy
